What
----

This is a simple tool that lets you create [videos like this][yt1] from [videos like this][yt2]

How
---
The first frame of the video produced is made up of the first row of pixels from every frame of the video, stacked one above another. The second frame is made up of all the second rows of pixels stacked up. When the input video is of a rotating object, each frame of input is slightly different, giving a twisting effect to the product. It's really quite pretty.

Issues
------
Currently this will load the entire input video into memory, consuming copious gobs of ram
